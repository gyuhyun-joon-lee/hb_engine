# Meka Renderer
Meka Renderer is a file only graphics renderer with minimum integration effort. 
For now, Meka Renderer supports Vulkan on Windows & Metal on MacOS(apple silicion)

# Why?
Third party libraries are meant to save you from unwanted works, so that you can focus on what you really want to do. 
However, a lot of the times, I found out that by using those libraries, people(including myself) tend to do more guessing than actually knowing how the code works.

Meka Renderer will be built and designed in a way that nothing is hidden, so that we can collect all the hidden or lost knowledges of CPU and GPU, and really understand how each part works and designed.

# Caveat
Meka Renderer is _not_ meant to be used professionally in any means. For now, this is more like a playground for me to learn and explore the world of graphics, which I am greatly interested in.
Feel free to explore, and if you want to keep track of the progresses, you can visit mekalopo.com
